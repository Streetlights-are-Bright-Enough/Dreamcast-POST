# Dreamcast-POST
A Simple memory test of the sega dreamcast 

A new project to run as a simple memory test, packaged with the selfboot used for Yarharing games for the dreamcast. 
Unlike my saturn one, this one can be used by pretty much everything. 

Current Status: 10% done 
Next project after this, a Mega drive/genesis project.

infact i will just go a head and make those repos and populate them later
